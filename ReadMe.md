# ReadMe

## Overview
I developed a personal portfolio website with several interactive features. While I did seek a bit of guidance to enhance specific areas, I implemented the majority of the functionality myself through exploration, coding practice, and some external references.

## How I Built It
### 1. **HTML file**
I started by creating the structure of the webpage in the `index.html` file:
- Added sections for the **header**, **countdown timer**, **about me** content, and **footer**.
- Used semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better readability.
- Implemented a countdown timer and a dynamic message for New Year celebrations.

### 2. **CSS file**
I used the `style.css` file to style the website:
- Designed a **responsive layout** to make the site look good on various screen sizes.
- Used **flexbox** for alignment in the "About Me" section.
- Applied a **linear gradient** background and subtle shadows to enhance the visual appeal.
- Wrote animations for smooth effects like the fade-in and fade-out of the New Year message.

### 3. **JavaScript file**
The `script.js` file adds interactivity:
- Programmed the **New Year countdown timer** logic to update dynamically every second.
- Added event listeners for smooth user interaction, like a demo preview button.
- Integrated a **particle animation** using [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) for the background to make the site more engaging.

## Challenges I Faced
1. **Countdown Timer Logic**:  
   I had to figure out how to calculate the remaining time dynamically and display it in real-time.

2. **Integrating Animation**:  
   Implementing the particle background using a third-party library required exploring its configuration options and styling it properly in CSS.

## How I Got Help
- I referred to online documentation and tutorials to understand the key concepts of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- For certain specific parts like animations and responsive layouts, I sought assistance from ChatGPT to overcome challenges and refine my work.
